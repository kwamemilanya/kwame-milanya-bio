<h1>Who is Kwame Milanya?</h1>
<p>A way to describe myself is that ever since I could talk I was a curios being with a passion for knowledge and a better understanding of the world we live in</p>
<p>Personally,I consider myself a man of few words.I probably could not hold a conversation with someone I have just met for more than five minutes give or take. This is could be from my introvert sort of nature and my lack of desire to establish new relationships with people,you could say I have a small bubble of people I interact with but to me this gives off a more genuine understanding of the people around me and how they operate.To try not to go on a tangent,describing myself could be one of the most difficult things someone could ask of me because I don't tend to give much insight or thought about who Iam as a person,I could probably forget how I look like if I didn't have a mirror in my house.Having said that though,this doesn't mean I invest on others more than I do myself really,I will always care about the wellbeing of others but not to an obsessive state.</p>
